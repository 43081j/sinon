# Sinon.JS

This page contains the entire Sinon.JS API documentation along with brief    introductions to the concepts Sinon implements. Please ask questions on <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/sinonjs\">the mailing list</a> if you're stuck. We also really appreciate suggestions to improve the documentation so Sinon.JS is easier to work with. Get in touch!
