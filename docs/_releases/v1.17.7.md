## FIXME: Out of date

The documentation in this folder is an earlier copy of the documentation in `sinonjs/sinon`, and not from `sinonjs/sinon-docs`.

We should probably re-import the documentation from `sinonjs/sinon-docs` again, and go over any documentation changes since that was last updated.

This page contains the entire Sinon.JS API documentation along with brief    introductions to the concepts Sinon implements.
